 * \brief This block provides a UDP source block that starts a
 * listener on the specified port and waits for inbound UDP packets.
 * \ingroup grnet
 *
 * \details
 * This block provides a UDP source that supports receiving data over
 * a UDP stream from external applications.  A number of header formats
 * are supported including None (raw stream), and other header formats
 * that allow for sequence numbers to be tracked.  This feature allows
 * the flowgraph to be aware of any frames dropped in transit or by
 * its receiving stack.  However, this needs to be appropriately
 * paired with the sending application (it needs to send the same
 * header).  The UDP packet size can also be adjusted
 * to support jumbo frames.  For most networks, 1472 is the correct
 * UDP data packet size that optimizes network transmission.  Adjusting
 * this value without a full understanding of the network implications
 * can create additional network fragmentation and inefficient packet
 * usage so should be avoided.  For networks and endpoints supporting
 * jumbo frames of 9000, 8972 would be the appropriate size
 * (9000 - 28 header bytes).  This block does support IPv4 only or
 * dual stack IPv4/IPv6 listening as an endpoint with an enable
 * IPv6 option that can be set on the block properties page.  It can
 * also be set to source zeros (no signal) in the event no data
 * is being received.
