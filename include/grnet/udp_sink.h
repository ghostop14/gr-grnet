 * \brief This block provides a UDP Sink block that can send
 * data over UDP streams to a specified host.
 * \ingroup grnet
 *
 * \details
 * This block provides a UDP sink that supports sending data over
 * a UDP stream to external applications.  A number of header formats
 * are supported including None (raw stream), and other header formats
 * that allow for sequence numbers to be tracked.  This feature allows
 * the recipient to be aware of any frames dropped in transit or by
 * its receiving stack.  The UDP packet size can also be adjusted
 * to support jumbo frames.  For most networks, 1472 is the correct
 * UDP data packet size that optimizes network transmission.  Adjusting
 * this value without a full understanding of the network implications
 * can create additional network fragmentation and inefficient packet
 * usage so should be avoided.  For networks and endpoints supporting
 * jumbo frames of 9000, 8972 would be the appropriate size
 * (9000 - 28 header bytes).  If send NULL packet as EOF is set, when
 * the flowgraph terminates, an empty UDP packet is sent.  This can
 * be used on the receiving side to be aware that no more data may
 * be received from the sending application.  When pairing with the
 * GNU Radio UDP source block, this isn't necessary and the source
 * block can simply be set to source zero's when an incoming network
 * data stream is not present in order to continue returning data
 * from the work function.  This block also supports IPv4 and IPv6
 * addresses and is automatically determined from the address
 * provided.
